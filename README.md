Plyyr's Wordpress plugin
==================

Captures requests that contain the plyyr parameter and generates a new post with the correspondent quiz embedded on it.

Example:

http://your-site.com?plyyr=quiz-54d507967664c-how-does-golf-work 

Generates a post with the quiz "How does golf work?" embedded on it.

If no quiz is found the user is redirected to your 404 page. Use it on combination with the plyyr iframe and generate instant content for your site.

In order to customize your plugin you should follow these optional steps:

* Enter <a href="http://plyyr.com/publishers">http://plyyr.com/publishers</a> and create a publisher account.
* Register your site and obtain a portal code.
* Paste the portal code on the wordpress setting's page.
